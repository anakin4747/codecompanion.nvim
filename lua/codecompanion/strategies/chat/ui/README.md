# UI Architecture Refactoring

This document describes the refactored UI architecture for the CodeCompanion chat buffer.

## Overview

The original UI implementation was a monolithic class handling multiple responsibilities in a single file (`init.lua` with 539+ lines). This has been refactored into a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## New Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Window Management (`window.lua`)
- **Purpose**: Handles opening, closing, and positioning windows
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Window creation (float, vertical, horizontal layouts)
  - Window positioning and sizing
  - Window visibility management
  - Window hiding/showing

#### 2. Buffer Management (`buffer.lua`)
- **Purpose**: Manages buffer state and operations
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Buffer locking/unlocking
  - Line manipulation (reading, writing, adding)
  - Buffer state queries (last position, line count)

#### 3. Headers Management (`headers.lua`)
- **Purpose**: Manages role headers and separators
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Header formatting for user/LLM roles
  - Extmark-based header rendering
  - Separator line management
  - Header highlighting

#### 4. Virtual Text Management (`virtual_text.lua`)
- **Purpose**: Handles virtual text overlays
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Intro message display
  - Virtual text placement and clearing
  - Extmark management for virtual content

#### 5. Cursor Management (`cursor.lua`)
- **Purpose**: Manages cursor position and scrolling
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Auto-scrolling behavior
  - Cursor following
  - Window focus tracking

#### 6. Renderer (`renderer.lua`)
- **Purpose**: Main rendering logic for chat content
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Message rendering coordination
  - Settings display
  - Context integration
  - Visual selection handling

#### 7. Main UI Class (`init.lua`)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates all components
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Component initialization
  - Public API maintenance
  - Backward compatibility
  - Component coordination

## Benefits

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Reduced coupling between different UI aspects
- Easier to test individual components

### 2. Maintainability
- Smaller, focused files are easier to understand and modify
- Clear boundaries between different UI concerns
- Easier to locate and fix bugs

### 3. Extensibility
- New UI features can be added as new components
- Existing components can be extended without affecting others
- Component interfaces provide clear extension points

### 4. Testability
- Individual components can be tested in isolation
- Mock dependencies are easier to create
- Test coverage can be more targeted

### 5. Backward Compatibility
- All existing API methods are preserved
- No breaking changes for consumers
- Migration is transparent

## API Compatibility

The refactored UI maintains 100% backward compatibility. All existing methods work exactly as before:

```lua
-- These all continue to work unchanged
ui:open(opts)
ui:hide()
ui:render(context, messages, opts)
ui:lock_buf()
ui:unlock_buf()
ui:follow()
ui:last()
ui:is_visible()
ui:is_active()
-- ... and all other existing methods
```

## Internal Usage

Components can be accessed internally for advanced use cases:

```lua
-- Access individual components
local window = ui.window
local buffer = ui.buffer
local headers = ui.headers
local cursor = ui.cursor
local renderer = ui.renderer
local virtual_text = ui.virtual_text

-- Use component-specific methods
buffer:lock()
cursor:follow()
headers:render()
window:hide()
```

## Testing

New comprehensive tests have been added in `test_ui_modular.lua` to verify:
- Component creation and initialization
- Component interfaces and methods
- Backward compatibility
- Inter-component references

## Migration

No migration is required. The refactoring is:
- **Non-breaking**: All existing code continues to work
- **Transparent**: Users don't need to change anything
- **Progressive**: New features can opt into the modular API

## Future Enhancements

The modular architecture enables future improvements:
- Theme management component
- Animation/transition component  
- Layout management component
- Performance monitoring component
- Custom component plugins
